# Super Cat Planet Archipelago!!!
Archipelago support for Super Cat Planet!!!! come collect cats! and hats! and other things that don't rhyme as well!

## What does randomization do to this game?

By default, only the colored switches and shop costumes are randomized! But you can also randomize every cat and strange cat, and include all the game's secret costumes too! A few miscellaneous things, like the pastry basket and the Thing that the secret boss gives you are also random!

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Everything! we're probably gonna add support for having local cats so you can have them all to yourself!!!

## What does another world's item look like in Super Cat Planet
Just like it does in the usual game!!

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Your cats and switches update immediately! Each time you load a save, all your items and checked locations will update, even if you deleted the save it mid-session! (Note: This does not work for items and locations whose randomization setting is disabled)

## Setup

- Download and extract SuperCatPlanetAP.zip from the latest release
- Run SuperCatPlanetAP.exe and connect to the server using the connection screen in-game

**Archipelago Features and Controls:**
- On connection screen: `Tab` cycles to next field, `Shift+Tab` cycles to previous field, `Enter` submits connection info
- Ingame: \` allows you to type to the text client, `Enter` sends a message, \` stops type-mode without sending a message.
