## What does randomization do to this game?

By default, only the colored switches and shop costumes are randomized! But you can also randomize every cat and strange cat, and include all the game's secret costumes too! A few miscellaneous things, like the pastry basket and the Thing that the secret boss gives you are also random!

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Everything! we're probably gonna add support for having local cats so you can have them all to yourself!!!

## What does another world's item look like in Super Cat Planet
Just like it does in the usual game!!

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Your cats and switches update immediately! Each time you load a save, all your items and checked locations will update, even if you deleted the save it mid-session!
